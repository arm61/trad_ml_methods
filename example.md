# The example data

By example I mean that it is fake data that I synthesized for this example.

The inspiration for each example were from the following:
- [QENS data in the "Some statistics seciton](https://qensmodels.readthedocs.io/examples/lmfit_lorentzian_and_backgd_fit.html)
- [Looking at wine composition with PCA](https://doi.org/10.1039/C3AY41907J)
- [Using PCA in muon spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04742.pdf)
