# Clustering

When there is a large number of datapoints, it is often useful for be able to group the data together into subclasses. 
For this, the traditional machine learning approach is a from of unsupervised learning known as clustering. 
Clustering methods aim to determine the optimial division of groups of data points; facilitating the labeling of these groups.

In this section, we will introduce k-means clustering which is available in the `scikit-learn` package. 
Then you will be able to apply this method in the categorization of SOMETHING.
