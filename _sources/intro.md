# Traditional Machine Learning Methods

Welcome to the material for the "Traditional Machine Learning Methods" of the LENS ML School.

You can find the lecture slides that were used to introduce this subject area [online here](https://mccluskey.scot/talks/trad_ml_methods).
During the working, it is suggested that you work through the material here. 
You can work along using one of these systems: 
- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/arm61/trad_ml_methods/HEAD)
Also, all of the code in this webpage is available on [Github](https://github.com/arm61/trad_ml_methods) (you will need this link if you are to use Colab). 
If you want to find a particular page in the Github repository, look at the url for the page these should match the files in the repository. 

This resource will be made available indefinitely so you can always come back to it for reference or to learn something new.
Additionally, I am happy for this resource to be shared with colleagues and collaborators.
