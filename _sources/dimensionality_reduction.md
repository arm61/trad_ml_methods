# Dimensionality reduction

Dimensionality reduction is an analytical tool, designed to reduce the number of features in our data. 
By features, we typically mean results from our measurements. 
The aim of a dimensionality reduction process is to find the most important features (or combinations of features) present in out data and allow us to drill down into these.
