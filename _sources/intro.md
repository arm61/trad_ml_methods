# Traditional Machine Learning Methods

Welcome to the material for the "Traditional Machine Learning Methods" of the LENS ML School.

Below, you will find the lecture slides (TODO) which will briefly introduce some of the subjects covered and show some applications in neutron science.
Then for the workshop, it is suggested that you select one of the methods and work through the material in this book in detail.
If there is time left over, you can work on another method.

This resource will be made available indefinitely so you can always come back to it for reference or to learn something new.
Additionally, I am happy for this resource to be shared with colleagues and collaborators.
